# GKI KernelSU SUSFS

Automated GKI kernel build repository.

> Not supported on OnePlus ColorOS 14/15. You may need to wipe data after flashing.

Attempted to build a GKI kernel with [hymo](https://github.com/Anatdx/hymo) integration. Since the project only supports kernel 6.6, it is not fully merged into the main branch.
Reference release: [hymo+gki](https://github.com/zzh20188/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS/releases/tag/v2.0.0-r19)

## Documentation

The detailed guide is maintained in the bilingual GitHub Wiki:
- Chinese Home: `wiki/Home.md`
- English Home: `wiki/Home-EN.md`

The wiki covers download/flash, bootloop handling, bug reporting, tips, KSU manager & SUSFS module, build time, emergency rescue, and kernel compatibility.
